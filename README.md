# odin-html-css-project
This was quite a journey. basic html properties then basic css properties then deep dive into the flexbox. Now finally, a project
made from scratch by myself, just myself. It's good to see this.
The only problem/ challenge i face is to start to make something. When i tackle this challenge and start creating the project, there was no going back, full focused and in one hour: less or more; don't know but completed and this is fun.
